---

## Overview

The **Open Demonstration and Mastery-Based Education Act (ODMEA)** is a comprehensive proposal to modernize U.S. education through public, interoperable skill registries, mastery-based learning pilots, transparent AI integration, and robust privacy, equity, and anti-abuse safeguards.

## What Does ODMEA Do?

- **Establishes a U.S. Open Competence Registry:**  
  A public, standards-driven infrastructure for recording, verifying, and sharing skills and learning achievements.

- **Launches Mastery-Based Learning Pilots:**  
  Federal grants for K-12 and higher ed institutions to trial mastery-based pathways and public AI copilots.

- **Enforces AI Transparency & Security:**  
  Model-card requirements, audit logs, signed builds, public SBOMs, and red-team exercises for any AI used in education.

- **Guarantees Public Portfolios:**  
  Learners can curate user-controlled portfolios as alternatives to traditional credentials.

- **Anti-Gatekeeping & Open Participation:**  
  Prohibits proprietary lock-in, ensures open participation, and creates appeals/penalties for exclusion.

- **Privacy, Equity & Accessibility:**  
  Annual equity audits, strong privacy by design, full compliance with FERPA, IDEA, and accessibility standards.
